# EmployeeSummary

# Introduction
I have built a software engineering team generator command line application. The application will prompt the user for information about the team manager and then information about the team members. The user can input any number of team members, and they may be a mix of engineers and interns. 

This application passes all unit tests. When the user has completed building the team, the application creates an HTML file that displays a team roster based on the information provided by the user.
